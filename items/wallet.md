# Wallet

![Wallet](/images/wallet.jpg)

My wallet keeps the essentials—ID, main card, and a small amount of cash—organized and secure. I prefer a slim design that fits my pocket and doesn't create bulk.

## Why I can't leave home without my Wallet

- ID and payment method for daily transactions.  
- A compact source of emergency cash.  
- Holds small items like transit cards or receipts.  
- A simple routine check: phone, keys, wallet.
