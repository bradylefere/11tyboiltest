# Keys

![Keys](/images/keys.jpg)

My keys get me into my place, start my bike, and often carry small tools (mini screwdriver, bottle opener). They're part of the "can't leave" trio.

## Why I can't leave home without my Keys

- Access to home and storage â€” leaving them behind can lock me out.  
- Security and peace of mind.  
- Utility on a keychain for quick fixes.  
- They're part of my daily pocket-check routine.
