## Keys

![Keys]({{ image }})

My keys are the one item I never leave home without. They get me into my space, start my bike, and keep small everyday tools (like a mini screwdriver or bottle opener) on hand.

### Why I can't leave home without my keys

- **Access**: They unlock my home and storage — leaving them behind locks me out.
- **Security**: Keys secure my belongings and give peace of mind.
- **Utility**: Keychains often carry small tools useful for quick fixes.
- **Routine**: They're part of my daily checklist — wallet, phone, keys.
